## Starting your project
1. To start a markdown project, create a new document in your favorite text editor and save it with the extension .MD.
2. Populate the file with the content that readers will need to begin working with your service. 

For example, describe the service in general terms, and then describe (or link to information about) how to set up an account, how to authenticate, and how to create a simple application that uses the service.
